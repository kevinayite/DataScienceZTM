Assignment: Pandas Practice
**Watch the next video: How to Download the Course Assignments if you are new to downloading and using Jupyter Notebooks from Github!**


Now you've seen some of what pandas can do, it's time to practice your skills!

In this assignment, there's a notebook full of exercises based on what we've covered in the previous videos.

Download the pandas exercises and solutions notebooks from GitHub and work through each cell using the techniques
 you've learned in the previous section.

Pandas Exercises notebook  	https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-2-data-science-and-ml-tools/pandas-exercises.ipynb

Pandas Exercises Solutions notebook (avoid looking at this for as long as possible) 

https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/blob/master/section-2-data-science-and-ml-tools/pandas-exercises-solutions.ipynb

Don't forget, if you get stuck, there's plenty of help available!

Remember, you should always try to run the code yourself first.

If you're still stuck feel free to ask the Discord server (Checkout the #machinelearning-datascience channel for help) 
or search the internet for answers.

Note: In the notebook, there may be instructions to import a file from a file path such as "../data/car-sales.csv", 
you should change these to wherever you're storing "car-sales.csv". Or the direct link on GitHub (in raw format), such as, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/master/data/car-sales.csv.

After giving it a shot on your own, how'd you go?

Of course, there is no right answer to this question. What's more important is giving it a go and trying to figure things out on your own.
