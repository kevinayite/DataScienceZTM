The error indicates that you are trying to calculate the mean on a pandas DataFrame that contains non-numeric columns. 

The key parts of the error are:

```
TypeError: Could not convert string 'BMW' to numeric
```

This shows that there is a column with the value 'BMW' which cannot be converted to a numeric value for calculating the mean.

And later in the traceback:

```
TypeError: agg function failed [how->mean,dtype->object]
```

This indicates the aggregation function 'mean' failed because the dtype is 'object', which means there are non-numeric columns.

To fix this, you need to either:

1. Drop the non-numeric columns before calculating mean.

2. Specify `numeric_only=True` in the `.mean()` method to exclude non-numeric columns.

For example:

```python
# Drop non-numeric columns
numeric_df = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]) 
numeric_df.groupby().mean()

# Or specify numeric_only=True
df.groupby().mean(numeric_only=True)
```

The key is to exclude any non-numeric columns from the aggregation, since you can't calculate mean on string values.
