Exercise: Contribute To Open Source
If you haven't done so already, it is time to contribute to your first open source project!


The contribution can be as big as a new feature, or as small as fixing a typo in the README.md file. Here is what we are going to do:



1. Join our Discord community (see Lecture 2 of this course).

2. Read this step by step guide by selecting "Open Source Projects".

3. If you have trouble with the steps above, watch this video and follow 
along to make your first contribution (and follow the ZTM youtube channel for weekly tip videos):
